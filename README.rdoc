regression in paper_trail 3.0.3

$ bundle exec rake db:migrate

$ bundle exec rails s

navigate to localhost:3000/high_scores

you will see

ActionController::RoutingError (undefined method `timestamp_sort_order' for #<Class:0x007feb5387a370>):
  app/models/high_score.rb:2:in `<class:HighScore>'
  app/models/high_score.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'
  app/controllers/high_scores_controller.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'

downgrade paper_trail to 3.0.2 and all is good.
